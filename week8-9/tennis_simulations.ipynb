    "# Tennis Simulations\n",

    "I'm a tennis fan (and player). Let's explore a few oddities of tennis scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a famous graduation speech at Dartmouth, recently retired tennis legend Roger Federer, pointed out that, over the course of his career, he won only 53% of the points he played. This seems kind of surprising, since he reached the finals, meaning he won six matches in a row, in 31 of 81 grand slams he competed in (38%). Did he just play a lot better in the grand slams, or is it plausible that he could have a high probability of winning matches even if he had only a slight edge on each point?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some players are really dominant as servers, but not as good at returning. They seem to go tie-breaks a lot, with players alternating serve and the server always winning until they reach 6-6 and play a tiebreak. How big a discrepancy in server vs. return point winning percentage is needed to make this happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Commentators often talk about certain players being \"clutch\" or \"choking\" in high-pressure situations. How much of a difference in match results would it make if a player had a boost in performance on high-pressure points?\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll learn a little about simulation."

    "# The Tennis Scoring System\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard scoring for a single game, the first player to get four points wins, but you have to win by two. For obscure historical reasons, the actual scoring looks more complicated:\n",
    "- instead of counting 0-1-2-3, we count love-15-30-40. \n",
    "- At 40-40, we stop using numbers and just say \"deuce\" meaning the score is tied.\n",
    "- From deuce, whoever wins the next point has the \"advantage\"; \n",
    "- if the player with advantage wins the next point, they win the game; otherwise it returns to deuce\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Winning a Set\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A set consists of a sequence of games. The first person to win six games wins the set, but you have to win by two. If the score is tied at 6-6, the players play a \"tie-break\", with the winner taking the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The players alternate who serves on a game-by-game basis, not within each game. When a player is serving, they serve all the points in that game.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the professional level, the server wins more games than the returner. A bit of terminology, if the server wins the game, it's called a \"hold\"; if the returner wins the game, it's called a \"break\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Winning a Match\n",
    "\n",
    "At the professional level, a match is best-of-three-sets, meaning that the first player to win two sets wins. In the four most important tournaments of the year, the so-called Grand Slams, the men play best-of-five-sets, meaning that the first player to win three sets wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tie-break Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "In a tie-break, one player serves one point, the other player serves two points, and thereafter they switch servers every two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regular tie-break, the first player to reach 7 points wins, but you have to win by two. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a deciding-set tiebreak (tied at 1 set each in a regular tournament; tied at 2 sets each in a men's Grand Slam), the victor is the first player to reach 10 points; again, you have to win by two. Thus, it's possible for a tie-break to end with a very high score, like 16-14, if it keeps being tied at 7-7, 8-8, 9-9, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Winning a Tournament\n",
    "\n",
    "On the professional tour, tournaments are conducted as single-elimination. In the grand slam tournaments, there are 128 players, so it requires seven rounds to determine a single champion. (In each round, half the players are eliminated; so after one round 64 players are left, after two 32 players are left, and so on. After seven rounds, only one player is left.)"

    "We will model a player as an instance of a `Player` class, with a few parameters:\n",
    "- their service skill, with a range of -10 to +10\n",
    "- their return skill, with a range of -10 to +10\n",
    "- their clutch factor, with a range of -10 to +10\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling a Point\n",
    "We will model the outcome of a point with a function `simulate_point` that takes two players as input and returns the winner of the point. The function will use a random draw for a \"Bernoulli\" random variable. It's like a coin flip, but the probability of \"heads\" (the server winning the point) is not necessarily 50%.\n",
    "- The probability of the server winning the point starts with a base probability of 0.5, to which we add the server's service skill and subtract the returner's return skill. \n",
    "  - If the point can decide the game, we also add the server's clutch factor and subtract the returner's clutch factor.\n",
    "  - If it is a clutch game, we will also add the server's clutch factor and subtract the returner's clutch factor. \n",
    "  - The clutch factors could be added twice if it is a game point in a clutch game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each point is independent of all other points; if a player wins one point, it doesn't affect the probability of winning the next point, except if it gives someone a game point."

    "1. In a famous graduation speech at Dartmouth, recently retired tennis legend Roger Federer, pointed out that, over the course of his career, he won only 53% of the points he played. This seems kind of surprising, since he reached the finals, meaning he won six matches in a row, in 31 of 81 grand slams he competed in (38%). Did he just play a lot better in the grand slams, or is it plausible that he could have a high probability of winning matches even if he had only a slight edge on each point?\n",
    "- If the probability of winning each point is 53%, what is the probability of winning a game, with standard scoring and no-ad scoring? (Before running the simulation, see if you can make a guess about whether the probability of winning a game will be higher or lower than 53%, and whether the probability is higher or lower with standard or no-ad scoring.)\n",
    "- Suppose that Feder actually had a 60% chance of winning each point when he served, and a 46% chance of winning each point when his opponent served, what was his probability of winning a set? the probability of winning a match? the probability of winning six matches in a row? More generally, given that Feder was going to win 53% of points overall, would it have been better for him to have a balanced advantage both serving and returning, or would it be better to have a bigger serving advantage and less when returning?\n",

    "2. Let's imagine that there are two dominant players on the tour who are much better than the rest of the players and both make it to the finals of tournaments pretty regularly. (This is true today on the men's tour: the players are Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.) Note that tournaments use a seeding system so that two two best players do not have to play each other until the finals. Now suppose that you are the coach for one of these top players, and you are obsessed with helping your player win more often against their chief rival. During the short off-season, you have three options for how you can work with your player, with three different expected outcomes. Which of these three power-ups would you choose to give your player?\n",
    "- You can work on their serve, the shot that starts a point, and follow-up shots to the serve. This will increase the player's winning percentage on their service points by +3.\n",
    "- You can work on their returns, the shot in response to a serve. This will increase the player's winning percentage when they are not the server by +3.\n",
    "- You can hire a sports psychologist who will improve the player's ability to handle high pressure points, whether as server or returner:\n",
    "  - if it's a game (or tie-break) that could decide the match, they improve their winning percentage by +4 on every point\n",
    "  - if it's a game (or tie-break) that could decide a set, but not the match, they improve their winning percentage by +2 on every point\n",
    "  - In addition, on any point that could decide the game, they improve their winning percentage by +3\n"
