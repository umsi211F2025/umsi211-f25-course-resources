# Week 8-9: Simulations

## Learning Objectives


After these three sessions on simulations, students will be able to:

1. Explain the concept of simulation.
2. Identify key components of a simulation: computable model; model execution as data generator; analysis and visualization.
3. Describe the difference between deterministic and stochastic simulations.
4. Identify scenarios where simulations are useful.
5. Implement simulations in Python (and/or React), and analyze the results.
