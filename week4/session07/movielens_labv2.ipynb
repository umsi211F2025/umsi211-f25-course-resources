    "We will use a three-step approach to data analysis with an AI assistant:\n",
    "1. **Decomposition**: Break down the high-level task into a sequence of smaller subtasks. \n",
    "    - Each subtask should take as inputs either raw data files (.csv files) or outputs from previous subtasks.\n",
    "    - The output of each subtask except the last will be used as input to a later subtask.\n",
    "    - Give each subtask a descriptive name.\n",
    "2. **Create Test Data**: Create small test versions of each of the .csv files that contain just enough data to be able to tests the correctness of the data analysis.\n",
    "3. **Write Down Correct Results for Test Data**\n",
    "    - Assume you have already implemented code that implements the subtasks (but don't actually implement it yet).\n",
    "    - Imagine running the code for sequence of subtasks, passing in the test data files as inputs.\n",
    "    - Write down what the correct output of each subtask should be, assuming it gets as input the test data files or the correct outputs of previous subtasks.\n",
    "4. **Implement Subtasks**: For each subtask, write code that implements it.\n",
    "5. **Run on Test Data**: Run the code on the test data files and check that the outputs match the correct outputs you wrote down.\n",
    "6. **Run on Full Data**: Once the code works on the test data, run it on the full data files to get the final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will use your AI assistant to help you with all of these steps! But feed it one of these tasks at a time, so if it gets something wrong, it will be easier to fix.**\n",

    "- How big should your test datasets be? What tradeoffs are involved in making them larger or smaller?\n",
    "- Instead of step 3, consider an alternative approach where you implement all the subtasks and run them on the test data in order to determine the correct outputs for the test data. What's wrong with that approach?\n"
