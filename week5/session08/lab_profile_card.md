# Lab Exercise: Profile Card

---
## Goal
- Build a static HTML page for a personal profile card
- Style it with an external CSS file

### Inspiration
- [Profile Card Examples](https://www.logoai.com/design/templates/profile-cards/)

Note: there are better tools for creating profile cards, such as Figma or Adobe XD or the site linked to above. This exercise is to practice HTML and CSS only. Don't worry if you can't make it look as good as those examples!

---
## Requirements
- Name
- Photo (or use a placeholder image; doesn't have to be your photo if you don't want)
- List of favorite hobbies, or address elements, or something similar



---
## Tips
- Use semantic HTML tags
- Keep CSS in a separate file
- Use Copilot for vibe coding: describe what you want, let Copilot generate code, and iterate
    - You may find it helpful to take screenshots showing how it looks and paste them into the copilot in order to explain what you want changed
- For testing today, we will use manual testing, not automated tests
    - Open your page in a browser frequently to see how it looks
