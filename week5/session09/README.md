## 1. Git & GitHub: Advanced Topics
- see `git-github-advanced.md` for slides

## 2. Lab Time: HTML & CSS Notebcards
- Continue working on your notebcard lab project from session08.
  - step 1: make sure you can access an HTML file in your browser (see instructions in session08/html_intro.md about starting a simple server)
  - step 2: create a .html file with linked .css file containing your notecard
  - step 3: update the .css file to style your notecard

## 3. Walkthrough: PS2 Bonus Problem Solution
- Instructor will present and explain their solution to the bonus problem from problem set 2.
- Opportunity to ask questions about the approach, code, and alternative solutions.
- Focus on how you can specify and verify tests, even for operations you don't really understand.



## 4. Tasks for the weekend
- Finish the notebcard lab project if not done in class.
- Verify any tests that you included in your PS2 that you didn't check previously. Resubmit if you find any issues. I may give a personalized quiz in class next Monday that asks you to explain something from your PS2.
