## Getting Started: Setting Up Your React App

To help you learn the process of starting a React project, you are responsible for setting up your own app from scratch. Here is a step-by-step outline of what you need to do. (You will definitely want to use Copilot to help you with this!)

1. Create a new React project using Vite, a modern build tool. Set up the project to use TypeScript.
2. Organize your source files according to the course React practices (see `react_practices.md`).
3. Add to the `.gitignore` file any kinds of files that should not be tracked by git (e.g., `node_modules`, build artifacts).
4. Make sure you can run the app locally and see the default starter page in your browser.
5. Set up the testing framework with Jest and React Testing Library. This may require installing some additional dependencies and configuring your project.
6. Create a simple test that checks that the main App component renders without crashing. Make sure you can run the test and see that they pass.
7. Commit your initial project setup to git with a clear commit message.


If you get stuck on any step, ask for help or consult the course resources.
