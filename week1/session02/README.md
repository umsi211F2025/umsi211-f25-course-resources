# Session 02

Welcome to Session 02! Below is the outline for todayâ€™s session, with links to relevant materials and instructions.

## Outline

1. How to follow along with slides, so you can copy and paste commands.

2. ** Update your local repository with the latest changes from GitHub**
    - In a terminal window, make sure your top-level directory of this repository is your working directory, then run:
```bash
./sync-updates.sh
```

It will pop open a file that shows what has been updated. You need to close that file in order to finish the update.

3. **[Mini-lecture: Using Copilot Chat](./copilot-chat.md)**  

4. **[Mini-lecture: Introduction to git and GitHub](./git-intro.md)**       

5. **Lab: Practice with git, Github** 

6. **Lab: Extend the Madlibs Program Using Copilot Chat**  

## Lab Exercise: Improve the Madlib program

- Look at the README.md file in the madlibs directory for some ideas of possible extensions you could implement.
    - Or come up with your own idea for an extension!

- Open the madlibs.py file and ask the copilot to explain how the code works.
    - If it uses programming or python terms that you don't understand, ask for clarification and tell it what level of description you need.
- Have a discussion with the copilot about alternative implementation approaches.
- Then ask it to implement your extension idea.
- Test it. Copy any error messages you get into the chat and ask it to diagnose and fix the errors.
