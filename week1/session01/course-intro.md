# Welcome to UMSI 211: Coding Without Coding
Course Introduction

---

## What is UMSI 211?
- Intro to programming
- Hands-on labs
- No prior experience required

---

## A Bold Hypothesis

It is now possible to become a competent programmer without first becoming fluent in a programming language.

- An AI assistant can express your ideas in code.

- You still need to understand the underlying concepts and logic of programming.

- But you don't need to learn the syntax of particular languages.

---

## But Why Learn to Program At All?

- The high-level skills of programming are useful in general problem-solving.

- You can create useful and fun programs!
  - data collection and analysis
  - automation of repetitive tasks
  - interactive visualizations
  - games
  - study tools
  - simulations

---

## Learning Goals for the Course

- Understand the fundamentals of programming logic and concepts.
- Use an AI assistant to understand, generate, and debug code.
- Be able to create programs that are useful to you.

---

## Approach

- Decompose computations into small, modular parts that can be reused.
   - Have planning discussions with your AI assistant where you consider multiple options for how to implement things.
- Write automated tests as a way to carefully express your intentions.
- Use the assistant to generate and debug code.
    - ask the assistant to explain what the code does
    - look at the actual code only to monitor which parts the assistant is changing (sometimes that provides a clue that it is doing the wrong thing).

## Course Logistics

- Lecture/lab mix every session.
- Outside of class:
    - Problem set most weeks
    - Some readings or videos
    - Expect to spend 6-9 hours/week
- Echo checks in class
    - short, written responses to questions about what you turned in for your problem set.
    - if responses suggest you just fed the entire assignment to an AI rather than engaging with the material, you will be asked to redo the assignment.
- Final project: build something *you* want to build! Be bold and ambitious.

---
## Grading

- Problem sets-- 490 points (49%)
- Class participation-- 200 points (20%)
- Final project-- 310 points (31%)
    - 15-minute oral interview during reading period


---
## Improvisation

- I will be adjusting the course content and process as we go.
    - Be flexible. Some things may change based on what is working or not working.
- I especially want to know when you're getting stuck, so I can figure out what it is students need to know for this new approach to programming.
