## Preview: Problem Set 1

- We will work with a text-based adventure game, in lecture/lab and for problem set 1, the next three sessions.

- There's a copy in this repository, in `weeks2-3/advent`.

    - Get your copy of it now; follow the instructions in Canvas for Problem Set 1.

    - Create a validator for game maps and then extend the game map.
- Next week
    - Extend the game mechanics (new items and actions)
