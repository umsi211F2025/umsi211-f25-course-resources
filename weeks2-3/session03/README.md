# Session 03: Functions and Unit Testing

Welcome to session03! This session focuses on understanding functions in Python and learning how to write and use unit tests, using the ADVENT game as a running example.

## Contents
- `admin.md`: Course administration stuff before we start on new material
- `functions.md`: Slides introducing Python functions and exploring the structure of the ADVENT game code.
- `../advent/advent.py`: The main game code.
- `unit-tests.md`: Slides introducing unit testing, with examples and exercises for writing and running tests.
- `...advent/test_advent.py`: Example unit tests for the ADVENT game.

## Learning Goals
- Understand what functions are and how they are used in Python programs.
- Read and reason about code structure, with help from your AI assistant.
- Learn the basics of unit testing: what tests are, why they matter, and how to write them.
- Practice writing and running tests for both simple functions and the ADVENT game.

## Tips
- If you see an error or test failure, read the message carefullyâ€”it often tells you exactly what went wrong!
    - But you may need the AI assistant to help you interpret it
- Use the AI assistant to ask questions about code, errors, or how to write new tests.
- Experiment! Try changing the code or tests and see what happens.
